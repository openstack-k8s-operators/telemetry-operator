                                      service traffic between nodes, and so each node
                                      will deliver traffic only to the node-local
                                      endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                                      the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent

                                      always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients
                                      sending to a NodePort from within the cluster
                                      may need to take traffic policy into account
                                      when picking a node.

                                      "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP
                                      address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints
                                      are determined by the selector or if that is
                                      not specified, by manual construction of an
                                      Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If
                                      clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated
                                      and the endpoints are published as a set of
                                      endpoints rather than a virtual IP. "NodePort"
                                      builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on
                                      every node which routes to the same endpoints
                                      as the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort
                                      and creates an external load-balancer (if supported
                                      in the current cloud) which routes to the same
                                      endpoints as the clusterIP. "ExternalName" aliases
                                      this service to the specified externalName.

                                  There are three important differences between dataSource
                                  and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.
