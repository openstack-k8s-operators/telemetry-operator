                                        externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
                                        receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts,
                                        ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
                                        the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                                        of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                                        traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                                        the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                                        be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                                        routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                                        features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                                        within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                        a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                                        when picking a node.

                                        type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                                        options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                                        "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                        to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                        specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                        EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                        allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                        than a virtual IP.
                                        "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                        routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                        "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                        (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                        as the clusterIP.
                                        "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                        Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                        This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when
                        the API field changed is acceptable.

                        Severity provides a classification of Reason code, so the current situation is immediately
                        understandable and could act accordingly.
                        It is meant for situations where Status=False and it should be indicated if it is just
                        informational, warning (next reconciliation might fix it) or an error (e.g. DB create issue
                        and no actions to automatically resolve the issue can/should be done).
                        For conditions where Status=Unknown or Status=True the Severity should be SeverityNone.
