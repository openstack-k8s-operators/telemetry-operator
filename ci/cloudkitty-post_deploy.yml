  # Need to set the images, since the defaulting is not working at the moment.
  # The container image is not being set, so the dbsync is failing.
  # The defaulting will not be done in the webhook until CK is added to the openstack-operator.
  # If I change the name of the CK, I can just configure using the CK CRD.
  # If I don't change the name, and disable it in telemetry, then the telemetry-operator will delete the telemetry telemetry.
