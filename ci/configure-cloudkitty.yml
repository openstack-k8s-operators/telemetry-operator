# I may need to do a post-deploy hook instead, so I can see what the errors are.
# I know that the openstack kustomization did no damage, but I should just remove this hook for now.
# There will be an alternative hook as a post_deploy for now.
# That should get to the point where we have must-gather running so that there is more information available.
